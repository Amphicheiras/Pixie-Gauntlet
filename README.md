# Pixie Gauntlet

## HARDWARE:

For this project I decided to solder the hardware together to have permanent, stable connections. I started with a perf board and designed the possible layouts in order to get the most compact piece of hardware. The following is what I came at:

The corresponding PCB trace-out would look something like this:

The above PCB design is not the optimal, but for the hardware in my stock, it did the trick. The next hardware version will be an optimized printed PCB circuit for the UF0 project.

The ESP32 pinout for this project can be seen below:

For the battery gauge I make a simple voltage divider using 2x10kÎ© resistors. This is necessary because the output voltage of the battery (3.7V - 4,2V) exceeds the maximum Vin (3.3V) of the ESP32 analog input pins. The power schematic follows:

Notice that the V+ of the battery is connected to the switch, and both the gauge and the TP4056 are connected to the other end of the switch, to completely kill the amperage from the system.

## EMBEDDED SOFTWARE:

The Pixie project is a continuation of the UF0 project, aiming for better code practices and motion sensor algorithms. The code structure is now more explicit, with better hierarchy and OOP, still, under development.

The basic components of this project are the:
- Hardware
- Music
- Network
- OS (Operating System)

The hardware components drive, unsuprisingly, the hardware parts of the project.

The music components handle MIDI operations and musical theory (soon to come).

The network components handle the WiFi connections and the  webserver functionality.

The OS components are in charge of the operation of the whole system and hold third party algorithms.
